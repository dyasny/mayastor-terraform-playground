# SYNOPSIS: mayastor-client [<argument> ...]

# run mayastor-cli that is (probably by omission) included in mayastor-csi this
# might stop working at any moment. If you need this, please create an issue

# NOTE: this is run *inside* the cluster with all consequences (e.g. for
# networking - you need to choose the right IP - e.g. in AWS use private ip)

# NOTE2: first run might take a bit as kubernetes need to pull the image first,
# subsequent runs are much faster
